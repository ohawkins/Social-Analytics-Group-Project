"Oh boy. More CGI nonsense for mentally underdeveloped manchildren. Wonderful.

The MCU films have become an endless and risk-free pack of Taco Bell mild sauce that is slowly dumbing down moviegoers and re-calibrating what a blockbuster film can be.

Disney is a black hole swallowing everything in its path until it is the only universe we have left. I bet you dollars to donuts no one here saw Silence or The Nice Guys in theaters but borrowed their dad's Subaru so you could see Ant-Man and the Wasp opening weekend.

I come from a generation where a creative ""face-swapping"" blockbuster film with $100M+ budget and an R-Rating from a foreign director could get a prime wide release date and make money. Now because of infantile consoomers who routinely get excited to pay for toy commercials with DoD propaganda, budgets are being slashed, young filmmakers are selling out, legends are relegated to streaming, and less people are getting laid.

To be clear, if you’re a grown adult and you're genuinely excited for a fringe piece of shit superhero movie like ""Spider-Man: We Brought Back the Gambling Addict Who Dates Women Half His Age"", you're a goddamn useless dork.

The MCU is crack for dumb people. They got you strung out and morons just blindly line up saying “the last couple MCU flicks have been lame, but I’ve seen all 47 of them to this point so I better watch Man-Ant vs The Gobots vs Dr Doom!”

McDonalds is quick, easy, cheap, and completely average in every way. Sure, from time to time it hits the spot but I usually end up feeling like shit and my ass leaks for 24 hours. It’s more work, more of a challenge, and sometimes can be disappointing but I’d much prefer to seek out a unique burger joint that at least will try to offer their own spin on things. I’m not 100% sure what I’ll get but it might be something interesting. Now everything is built on franchise recognition and familiarity and more and more people are conceding everyday - which puts my ability to go to my kind of restaurant at risk. Companies follow the money and may offer the occasional artisan option - but if it ain’t, selling it’ll be replaced something easier to sell. Hell, these lazy morons don’t even dine out anymore - they sit on their couch and have their compressed, shitty, and inoffensive content delivered directly to their homes.

Happy Meal fucks who justify watching a decade of toy commercials and hand every nickel to corporations who call movies “content” not realizing they’re setting the rest of us up are the worst.

Watch what you want, but when I can’t see something like C'mon C'mon or Memoria or Licorice Pizza on a big screen because the theaters have got 16 screens all playing Hawkeye vs Han Solo, I’m blaming you.",True,oh boy cgi nonsense mentally underdeveloped manchildren wonderful mcu film become endless riskfree pack taco bell mild sauce slowly dumbing moviegoer recalibrating blockbuster film disney black hole swallowing everything path universe left bet dollar donut one saw silence nice guy theater borrowed dad subaru could see antman wasp opening weekend come generation creative faceswapping blockbuster film 100m budget rrating foreign director could get prime wide release date make money infantile consoomers routinely get excited pay toy commercial dod propaganda budget slashed young filmmaker selling legend relegated streaming le people getting laid clear grown adult genuinely excited fringe piece shit superhero movie like spiderman brought back gambling addict date woman half age goddamn useless dork mcu crack dumb people got strung moron blindly line saying last couple mcu flick lame seen forty-seven point better watch manant v gobots v dr doom mcdonalds quick easy cheap completely average every way sure time time hit spot usually end feeling like shit as leak twenty-four hour work challenge sometimes disappointing id much prefer seek unique burger joint least try offer spin thing one hundred sure ill get might something interesting everything built franchise recognition familiarity people conceding everyday put ability go kind restaurant risk company follow money may offer occasional artisan option selling replaced something easier sell hell lazy moron even dine anymore sit couch compressed shitty inoffensive content delivered directly home happy meal fuck justify watching decade toy commercial hand every nickel corporation call movie content realizing setting rest u worst watch want see something like cmon cmon memoria licorice pizza big screen theater got sixteen screen playing hawkeye v han solo blaming

If Garfield and Maguire are in this thing, I don’t think Sony is doing themselves any favors by hiding it.

Also, the jokes here are really bad. I rolled my eyes big time at the scene where they make fun of Otto’s name. Like, yeah, comic book characters have silly names. We get it. It felt like another “Taser Face” scene, where the characters are just laughing about something that really isn’t funny. Then they did that dumb Scooby-Doo joke not once, but twice.

"That's an interesting point that gets lost in all the hype about Toby and his rogues:

Between the three Peters, Garfield's is the only one that has suffered the most direct tragedy of Spider-Man's life other than Uncle Ben: the Night Gwen Stacy Died.

Toby's lost Harry, but that was self sacrifice and redemptive on Harry's part; Peter didn't bare responsibility for it. Holland's lost Tony but that had nothing to do with Peter directly.

Garfield's the only one of the three that has objectively failed to disastrous consequences and suffered for it. There's no ambiguity like the comic, she's conscious as she falls, you hear her spine snap, you see her head hit the concrete, they don't cut away. It's brutal. Say what you want about the Amazing Spider-Man movies but they had the guts to go dark, sacrifice the incredible chemistry between its two leads, and have Peter suffer that critical, character defining failure (even if they handled the setup sloppily). That plot thread was very hastily tied up so the credits could roll with us feeling Peter was ok. But really, we left Garfield's Peter in a very dark place. Toby's and Holland's Peters each have their MJs. When we last saw Garfield's, he was alone. No Gwen, no Harry. We haven't *really* seen how that night changes him yet and how he bounces back.

That creates a really interesting dynamic between the three that I hope to hell they explore. Andrew Garfield was a great Spider-Man, and when he weeps over Gwen he sells that pain better then Toby or Holland could. He deserves a moment to shine in a much better movie than the two he was given. Especially because Andrew is older now and his Peter can be slightly more mature, more experienced, with a weight on his shoulders the other two don't carry.

Edit: Another way to think of it,.kind of like their respective film series, Toby will be our Silver Age Spidey. Andrew, the Bronze Age. Holland, Modern Age (the *actual* Modern Age, 2000 and later)",False,interesting point get lost hype toby rogue three peter garfield one suffered direct tragedy spiderman life uncle ben night gwen stacy died toby lost harry self sacrifice redemptive harry part peter bare responsibility holland lost tony nothing peter directly garfield one three objectively failed disastrous consequence suffered ambiguity like comic conscious fall hear spine snap see head hit concrete cut away brutal say want amazing spiderman movie gut go dark sacrifice incredible chemistry two lead peter suffer critical character defining failure even handled setup sloppily plot thread hastily tied credit could roll u feeling peter ok really left garfield peter dark place toby holland peter mjs last saw garfield alone gwen harry really seen night change yet bounce back creates really interesting dynamic three hope hell explore andrew garfield great spiderman weeps gwen sell pain better toby holland could deserves moment shine much better movie two given especially andrew older peter slightly mature experienced weight shoulder two carry edit another way think kind like respective film series toby silver age spidey andrew bronze age holland modern age actual modern age two thousand later

My heart was literally pounding throughout it and it is everything a Spider fan like me has always wanted. The multiverse is coming alive and I absolutely love it. I also like how Strange and Peter actually fail to make people forget that he's Spiderman, as Ned and MJ still remember, and Strange even says they botched the spell.

I like this because it shows that the consequences of FFH are still in place within the films story, and I'm still interested to see how they interwove it, not sure how I feel about Spiderman letting the villains go after capturing them, but as long as the execution as too why is good and the explanation itself is good, then I won't be too bothered by it. It also seems they will be doing the Death of Gwen Stacy, but with MJ, though I have a feeling that will be a misdirection, in the sense MJ may not be the one who dies, but instead probably someone like Ned or Aunt May or someone like that. Also seeing Electro, Lizard, and Sandman all in frame, and hearing Green Goblin speak, and actually seeing him on-screen again.

I guess they're really doing the multiple suit thing, it's not my preferred version of Spider-Man who carries his suit with him just in case and has to outsmart his villains in the fight itself rather than just show up with a new suit to negate their powers. Like, in one very early comic, the Vulture dropped Spider-Man in a water tower, and he couldn't stick to the sides or use his web shooters, so he was going to eventually drown, as no one was anywhere close who could see or hear them. He ended up getting out by sinking to the bottom and using all his strength to leap through the water and high enough to grab an edge, it was a clever way to solve the problem.

"It would be cool if they made Garfield into a live action Last Stand Spider-Man. Going full antihero after losing Gwen, and possibly Aunt May not long after. Holland doesn't want to kill anyone, but these ghosts are likely fighting for the multiverse to merge, which will probably cause destruction on a grand scale, but will give them a second chance at life. While struggling with the blame for killing Mysterio the ""hero"", Holland now has to deal with the possibility of killing the Sinister Six to save innocent lives.
Garfield will have no problem killing the Six, but will be doing it out of rage, not a sense of justice. Holland is scared of Garfield, of the Spider-Man he could become.
Macguire could be serving as the veteran Spider-Man, the ""grandfather superhero"". He's there to share his wisdom and show the younger heroes that life can be hard but there's always a way to pull through, just like he did. Garfield sees him as an old fool because he's never lost the things Garfield has. Maybe Aunt May is lost in a similarly tragic fashion, like Gwen. Holland sees him as the old timer who he respects, but still had life easy, and didn't have to deal with the same struggles as a modern/MCU hero, something that may connect with audiences, as at worst Macguire had to deal with Sand-Man and a crummy rip-off of Venom, whereas Holland fought Thanos and died.

Maybe Garfield gets a redemption arc and the other Spider-Men help him find his center again, a new sense of justice. Holland is mentored by the others on how to deal with the pressure of being Spider-Man, specifically with making the right call as a hero, or rather, they show him he's had what it takes all along. Macguire's Spider-Man finished with a decent note, and he pretty much redeemed himself in the end of Spider-Man 3. Maybe he gets a refined perspective on what matters in life.

In the end, I want all Spider-Men learning from one another, and healing one another as they deal with their greatest threat yet.",False,would cool made garfield live action last stand spiderman going full antihero losing gwen possibly aunt may long holland want kill anyone ghost likely fighting multiverse merge probably destruction grand scale give second chance life struggling blame killing mysterio hero holland deal possibility killing sinister six save innocent life garfield problem killing six rage sense justice holland scared garfield spiderman could become macguire could serving veteran spiderman grandfather superhero share wisdom show younger hero life hard always way pull like garfield see old fool never lost thing garfield maybe aunt may lost similarly tragic fashion like gwen holland see old timer respect still life easy deal struggle modernmcu hero something may connect audience worst macguire deal sandman crummy ripoff venom whereas holland fought thanos died maybe garfield get redemption arc spidermen help find center new sense justice holland mentored others deal pressure spiderman specifically making right call hero rather show take along macguire spiderman finished decent note pretty much redeemed end spiderman three maybe get refined perspective matter life end want spidermen learning one another healing one another deal greatest threat yet

"&gt; Partially because he's still just a kid, in over his head. Partially because he knows the people back home need him.

I agree with this only in part, because for me in the MCU movies the first half of that statement is doing most of the heavy lifting. The reasoning Holland's Spidey gives for not wanting to be an Avenger or not wanting to help Fury or whatever, is that he's still a kid, he's doesn't feel ready. It's less I-wanna-be-in-New York and more a I-just-wanna-be-a-kid. 

We see him in Germany for Civil War, then in Queens/D.C. for Homecoming, then outer space for Infinity War, then Europe in Far from Home. We've seen him in three and a bit movies and he's been Spider-Man twice as much outside of NY as he's been in it. It'd be fine to have Spider-Man go away from but ultimately return to NYC, but you have to establish him there first, and I don't feel like Homecoming does a good enough job of that, especially since he does as much Spider-Man stuff in D.C. as he does in Queens.

Raimi’s felt like a cartoon in live action, ASM tried to be a bit more grounded. MCU Spider-Man has leaned into the fact that it’s not uncool to be into STEM now, but he’s still kind of awkward but you’d get why he’d be charming enough to overcome that and get the girl, where Tobey’s Peter never stopped being that caricature of a dweeb but landed a supermodel girlfriend that lets him constantly disrupt her life.

I think you’re wrong though, Spider-Man 2 is remembered as one of the great comic book movies, it’s why 3 is remembered as such a let down.

"Look, we also know it's likely Venom is in this somehow based on the end credits there. We also conveniently don't see Doc Oc in that final battle scene and considering he was the most apologetic villain out of all of them (besides sandman but he's in the scene with the baddies soooo) he could have a turning point in the movie. 

Those empty spaces could just as easily be Venom and Doc Oc. I could see them showing up for the final battle sure, but it's equally likely that it's Doc Oc turning to good (like he's done countless times) and Venom aiding Parker(which he's also done, and is conveniently not pictured in anything related despite his end credit scene) is what is missing in this scene. 

It makes way more sense for them to save Tobey and Andrew for a full fledged spider verse movie rather than 15 minutes of screen time for a single battle and maybe an afterward.

To end: I know the leaks, I think they're bullshit for the most part, I could be wrong but Y'know, I'd rather they not be in it then have it be another terrible third act overcrowded and ineffective.

"That’s not why Electro was angry.

Max was a paranoid schizophrenic consistently abused and mistreated by seemingly nearly everyone in his life, including his own mother via a deleted scene.

This is why he was so infatuated with Spider-Man, which lead to a blatant unhealthy obsession with him. Max stays late on his birthday thanks to an asshole boss, gets his powers, and wakes up extremely terrified and confused, leading him to Times Square.

The scene proceeds with Max being scared and upset, likely even more unstable mentally now that his body is completely changed, but is also suddenly overwhelmed with the sense that for the first time in his life, people SEE him. He has everyones attention, and for once he doesn’t go unnoticed.

This is why he gets so angry at Spider-Man, not only does the events of Time Square lead Max to think Peter is selfish and that he stole the peoples attention, causing them to have contempt towards Electro, but he also thinks the one he idolized most had lied to him and betrayed him.

I know ASM2 gets a bad rap and for good reason, but Electro to me is the highlight of the film, and is FAR more interesting than his comic version.",False,electro angry max paranoid schizophrenic consistently abused mistreated seemingly nearly everyone life including mother via deleted scene infatuated spiderman lead blatant unhealthy obsession max stay late birthday thanks asshole bos get power wake extremely terrified confused leading time square scene proceeds max scared upset likely even unstable mentally body completely changed also suddenly overwhelmed sense first time life people see everyone attention go unnoticed get angry spiderman event time square lead max think peter selfish stole people attention causing contempt towards electro also think one idolized lied betrayed know asm2 get bad rap good reason electro highlight film far interesting comic version

Maybe the final result will have a lot of quips throughout and it'll annoy people, but the fact is that nobody knows that for sure.

"I'll always defend Toby. His Peter wasn't so much a Poindexter nerd as somebody who would be ""the weird kid"", a loser more than a traditional geek. He's poor and therefore never got to be like, fashionable, his Uncle and Aunt are older and need his help to do housework, I very much feel like he's a very real guy who is nice but largely just missed a lot of the traditional experience growing up that kids have, he's somebody who's a little too poor, a little too awkward, a little too different to be invited to a sleepover, couldn't afford to get lunch at school or go to the movies, and the wedge deepens over the years, I find that to all be very authentic. When he's waving at Mary Jane, thinking she waved at him, only to realize she didn't see him there and that she's meeting up with the people behind him, it's so cringe, while also being a perfect illustration of who he is. The scene where he kind of snaps at Uncle Ben is heartbreaking, the scene where he finds him shot and dying is great, he's just casually walking and wants to see what's going on, only to be shocked and giving a good ugly cry is great. Uncle Ben just shakily says ""Peter? Peter"", none of the ""let me give you a life lesson as I die"" crap. His dying Uncle looks around in delirium, settling on him after Peter says, ""I'm here"". More than him losing his Uncle, to go back to the Mary Jane wave scene, him saying ""I'm here"" to Uncle Ben's relief, him not being to see him at first, he's losing the only person who looks for him, sees him. When he hears the cop behind him saying that they have the shooter in the church or whatever it is, the transformation from ugly crying to quiet rage, all rage stopping, he looks like he's going to kill the guy that did this. Maybe he would if he wasn't stunned to see that he knew the shooter from earlier. Anyway, a very good Peter in my mind.

Andrew Garfield gets a big *fart sound* from me. Not that it's his fault, he did get to play Spider-Man as a little more of a wisecracking guy, which is accurate, but he was not a good Peter. He skateboarded around the school, being all snarky, stealing his inventions, he was like Bart Simpson.

"That's the result of Spider-man coming in so late into the MCU. In a world where half the heroes live in NY, and for pretty much every film after The Avengers, there is always the question of ""Why didn't X just call in Y for help""

The MCU has danced around this with varying degrees of success. They've mostly tried to keep the climax to a very sudden build-up so X didn't have time to try to call in Y, or it takes place so far away from where the heroes live. With the Netflix shows, they basically said that no one but the people living in Hell's Kitchen give a shit about that place. Wakanda kept its finale in Wakanda. The Immortals (yeah, I haven't forgotten that was a thing) got put in Hawaii.

Spider-man has villains that can't go under the radar. No way Stark, if he were alive, would have let Electro run around NY or let a suited Green Goblin fly around and come off like an attempt to replicate the Iron Man suit. Hell, Peter tried to get Tony involved with the Vulture (and Tony stupidly left Peter out of the loop, or the movie may have been resolved on the ferry with Toomes' arrest).

"I hated ASM 1 so much that I couldn't bring myself to watch the second.

I get that in many of the origin takes, Peter is angry and his emotions lead to him making a bad decision where Ben dies, but Peter remains angry and vengeful and whiny for most of the movie. He hells at his girlfriend's father. He whines to his girlfriend that no one else can fight the villain and I guess that is supposed to be the moment where he shifts into being heroic but it doesn't come across that way.

He then proceeds to make a promise to a dying man, only to immediately break it, which results in Gwen dying because Peter broke his word.

They also marketed the film as having this secret backstory of Spider-Man that no one has ever told, and I don't think Sony ever figured out what that was. The vaguely hinted at things with his parents I guess that they still don't explain the sequel and the stingers at the end of the first film also went unresolved.

Sony desperately wanted this bigger universe with tons of films so they hinted at the future but they didn't have specific plans.",False,hated asm one much could bring watch second get many origin take peter angry emotion lead making bad decision ben dy peter remains angry vengeful whiny movie hell girlfriend father whine girlfriend one else fight villain guess supposed moment shift heroic come across way proceeds make promise dying man immediately break result gwen dying peter broke word also marketed film secret backstory spiderman one ever told think sony ever figured vaguely hinted thing parent guess still explain sequel stinger end first film also went unresolved sony desperately wanted bigger universe ton film hinted future specific plan

I call that bullshit because I know a couple of kids when I was in high school that know-how cosplay at a professional level. Even in the comics that Pete knows sewing and that's how he made his costume. I feel that people underestimate that some kids know how to pull off. 

Going to the topic of Tony, MCU made him more bigger impact on Peter's life than Uncle Ben. I feel they shifted him hard in MCU because he plays such a huge role in his life through all the media of spidey.",False,also dislike never made spidey costume like comic movie people always say unrealistic teenager type costume call bullshit know couple kid high school knowhow cosplay professional level even comic pete know sewing made costume feel people underestimate kid know pull going topic tony mcu made bigger impact peter life uncle ben feel shifted hard mcu play huge role life medium spidey
"I used to edit movie trailers for a living from my experience it seemed like almost **all** the coloring gets done in the last month of post-production along with VFX. We edited trailers using first drafts of the cut, then the studio would prioritize getting color and VFX done for the scenes used in the trailer, then send those over piece by piece, then an assistant editor slices the scenes in. Also, the scenes they send over are usually very rushed (about a 24-48 hour turnaround) and are very rarely rushed.

All these people blaming SONY as if they are the ones making the trailer. That never happens and it's usually only 1 or 2 people from the studio giving input. They send early cuts of the movie to trailer houses and then it's a bidding war based on who made the ""best"" trailer.",False,"used edit movie trailer living experience seemed like almost coloring get done last month postproduction along vfx edited trailer using first draft cut studio would prioritize getting color vfx done scene used trailer send piece piece assistant editor slice scene also scene send usually rushed two thousand, four hundred and forty-eight hour turnaround rarely rushed people blaming sony one making trailer never happens usually one two people studio giving input send early cut movie trailer house bidding war based made best trailer"

"Jesus fucking christ, with some of the comments here you'd think people have already seen and judged the entire movie somehow from a 3 minute trailer that didn't even need to show too much because the movie's already sold itself whether you realize it or not. You guys and gals need to chill out.

Are some of the jokes shown here lame? Sure, but when has a Spider-man movie ever been devoid of lame humor and jokes that just don't land? I've personally found the MCU Spider-man movies to have plenty of humor that works really well. I'm inclined to think there will be plenty of jokes that land just fine in the final product, and I'm sure a lot of them are far more spoilery than they were willing to show in this trailer. But I can't say for sure because... this is just a trailer! 

Does the CGI look unfinished? I guess in some shots? I really didn't notice anything so terrible that I felt the need to endlessly bitch about it given it's just a trailer and post-production is often worked on until the very last minute. 

If the trailer didn't do much for you, that's cool. If you're just not really interested in seeing this, also totally cool. None of the stuff in the Eternals trailers did anything for me, and as much as I enjoy keeping up on the MCU, I decided to skip that one (will probably just catch it once it's streaming) because I just couldn't get into it. And if that's how some of you feel about this, there's nothing wrong with that. 

I'm personally glad it didn't really reveal or spoil much of anything that I didn't already know from the last trailer. And the conflict they're setting up between Strange and Peter is pretty interesting. And I'm very thankful they didn't spoil the Garfield / Maguire reveal or show them at all because that would have actually pissed me off a little. They don't need to show them. We already know they're in it. I'm sure the movie's best scenes are going to feature the three of them, so I'm perfectly content with being surprised when I actually go to see the movie. The vibe this trailer gives me is that there's a LOT they obviously don't want to show until it comes out. I can practically feel the editor(s) of this trailer being like ""Ok, I have to make sure this shot or this take doesn't spoil Maguire or Garfield's presence in any way, or show off too much of the other villains."" So all they're really left is setting up the basic conflict for Holland's Peter and Dr. Strange, and then throwing in the MCU characters we already expect to see.",True,jesus fucking christ comment would think people already seen judged entire movie somehow three minute trailer even need show much movie already sold whether realize guy gal need chill joke shown lame sure spiderman movie ever devoid lame humor joke land personally found mcu spiderman movie plenty humor work really well inclined think plenty joke land fine final product sure lot far spoilery willing show trailer say sure trailer cgi look unfinished guess shot really notice anything terrible felt need endlessly bitch given trailer postproduction often worked last minute trailer much cool really interested seeing also totally cool none stuff eternals trailer anything much enjoy keeping mcu decided skip one probably catch streaming could get feel nothing wrong personally glad really reveal spoil much anything already know last trailer conflict setting strange peter pretty interesting thankful spoil garfield maguire reveal show would actually pissed little need show already know sure movie best scene going feature three perfectly content surprised actually go see movie vibe trailer give lot obviously want show come practically feel editor trailer like ok make sure shot take spoil maguire garfield presence way show much villain really left setting basic conflict holland peter dr strange throwing mcu character already expect see

- our doctor strange would never say “scooby-doo this crap”, let alone say “please” followed by a smirk
- when he’s talking to Peter, he says “when you botched that spell where you wanted everyone to forget that peter parker is spiderman”. a few things here: sure, maybe Peter is the one who botched it, but why would DS refer to him in the third person? Also if you watch the trailer again, notice “Peter”’s clothes in that clip. When they show DS, “Peter” somehow has a dark jacket and blue collar? Seems sus.

"Every time I see a trailer like this that tries to pander to a base that is nostalgic for previous iterations of a beloved IP, I think to myself that this is it, they'll finally get it right this time and everyone will love this franchise again, and all my old friends will come back and we can talk about it all the time like we used to between classes, everyone sharing opinions and hot takes, and you'll be hooked just like you were back then, and your head will be filled with thoughts of fantastic worlds and adventures as you slog through your day. Maybe this time everything can go back to how it was. I see  trailers drop featuring characters or ideas I remember from my formative and simpler years, and I get hit by this faint hope for what once was, that we can recapture that special time in our lives we all had at one time or another, sitting in front of the soft glow of a tv, or reading a comic or picture book secretly under your desk while the teacher droned about something or other. I see people get mad, and bitch online about how “all you see these days are reboots and sequels,” that these big media companies don't wanna do anything original anymore, but why would they, when they know that what we want is what we already had? They've been selling us nostalgia for decades now, and we keep buying because we all yearn for that bygone era of staying awake 'till 11 on a school night, excited and eager to keep watching.

And honestly, whether people eat it up or bitch about it, there has been no marked improvement or decline in the storytelling or production of any of these franchises, past or present, because they aren't selling you a new thing, they're selling you ghosts of memory of that time you stayed up all night playing in PVP matches, or watching youtube clips of your favorite scenes, or listening to the opening theme song and getting hyped as fuck. The good old days when that kind of shit was your top concern. Ah, if only I could give a shit about anything now, as much as I gave a shit about L dying in Death Note, or about which damn Yu-gi-oh cards would complete my deck, or the time Robin betrayed the Teen Titans. But 2 roads diverge in a yellow wood, and we opt to stand in place and spin around in circles for 15 fucking years.

And you see these nostalgia-baiting reboots and sequels and you can't help but reminisce. I might as well be walking through my fucking high school campus, reminiscing about hanging out after school in the computer lab with all the other weeaboo degenerates talking about which anime were good and which were shit, reminiscing about staying up late at night messaging online about shit, swapping weird nonsense we'd found on newgrounds, the primitive origins of internet memes, dicking around with my brother and ignoring homework after dinner before he left for college, the good old days when those friends were more than just memories. Coming home late from practice, strung out on a terrible diet and a poor sleep cycle, and hopping on the computer to waste your fuckin youth, but at least you could waste it on your own terms. Every day sucked, but at night you could sit back and watch some cheesy nerd shit and let it all wash away.

But that's just it. It's not about what these things WERE, it's about what purpose they served at one point in the larger context of your life. According to what I just googled, nostalgia is defined as a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past. Typically for a period or place with happy personal association. It's derived from the Latin words for “homecoming,” and “ache.” fucking ache. We just want these movies to give us what we had that one time, whatever that one time may have been for you. But they'll NEVER be able to do that, because it wasn't media itself that made those times of your life special. And you will never be able to get those times back. The best moments in life were never spent trying to recapture other moments.

So no, I'm not hyped for this fuckin movie. I still have the original raimi trilogy, and it isn't going anywhere. I don't want to circle this drain anymore.",True,every time see trailer like try pander base nostalgic previous iteration beloved ip think finally get right time everyone love franchise old friend come back talk time like used class everyone sharing opinion hot take hooked like back head filled thought fantastic world adventure slog day maybe time everything go back see trailer drop featuring character idea remember formative simpler year get hit faint hope recapture special time life one time another sitting front soft glow tv reading comic picture book secretly desk teacher droned something see people get mad bitch online see day reboots sequel big medium company want anything original anymore would know want already selling u nostalgia decade keep buying yearn bygone era staying awake till eleven school night excited eager keep watching honestly whether people eat bitch marked improvement decline storytelling production franchise past present selling new thing selling ghost memory time stayed night playing pvp match watching youtube clip favorite scene listening opening theme song getting hyped fuck good old day kind shit top concern ah could give shit anything much gave shit l dying death note damn yugioh card would complete deck time robin betrayed teen titan two road diverge yellow wood opt stand place spin around circle fifteen fucking year see nostalgiabaiting reboots sequel help reminisce might well walking fucking high school campus reminiscing hanging school computer lab weeaboo degenerate talking anime good shit reminiscing staying late night messaging online shit swapping weird nonsense would found newgrounds primitive origin internet meme dicking around brother ignoring homework dinner left college good old day friend memory coming home late practice strung terrible diet poor sleep cycle hopping computer waste fuckin youth least could waste term every day sucked night could sit back watch cheesy nerd shit let wash away thing purpose served one point larger context life according googled nostalgia defined sentimental longing wistful affection past typically period place happy personal association derived latin word homecoming ache fucking ache want movie give u one time whatever one time may never able medium made time life special never able get time back best moment life never spent trying recapture moment hyped fuckin movie still original raimi trilogy going anywhere want circle drain anymore

"THE INHERITORS in No Way Home Theory

In the last scene of the trailer where dr strange was telling peter that ""they're starting to come through and i can't stop them"", what if he was referring to the Inheritors, Morlun and his family.
https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Inheritors_(Earth-001)

Given that the MCU is currently introducing Morbius, Blade &amp; Moon Knight, plus there was a rumor that Morlun was already casted (Ethan Hawke) as a Villain in Moon Knight.
https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/moon-knight-who-is-ethan-hawke-morlun-spider-man/

Now Marvel also a No Way Home action figure toy line that was release where Morlun was among the Toy's that was included amongst the main characters of No Way Home, which also included Cindy Moon (Silk). Funny that Cindy Moon was already in the Infinity War, and Homecoming movies, as Peter's schoolmate.

And if so, if they will really introduce us to the Inheritors, the whole spiderverse will have a really interesting story and turn of events, given that the Inheritors jump from realm to realm, or in this case, universe to universe to hunt for the totems, thus giving MCU a large story to play with in the spiderverse continuity.

I really hope so that the MCU will connect it all through the movies and series that they are currently releasing for the current MCU phase.

MCU Fans will be more excited for Tobey and Andrew's appearance, while comic book fans will be more excited for the different connections of the comic stories and lore.

Yes, his later MCU appearances tended to be among world-ending events but him not being in an Avengers movie after being introduced into the MCU would’ve just felt like a missed opportunity. Not to mention, that’s what everyone was clamoring for at the time.

It’s funny how much nostalgia can color the perception of a movie. 

True, TASM 2 had a dark ending with Peter failing to save Gwen but the fact is that it was so shoehorned in at the end with a horrid version of Goblin doing the deed, not to mention all the stupid plot elements before that moment, that while the moment was emotionally effective ( which I feel is more due to how good Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone’s performances were in a movie that didn’t do justice to them ), it didn’t feel earned if that makes sense.",False,snippet homecoming probably among grounded spidey movie mean literally fight vulture father girlfriend spidey get homemade costume spending majority movie suburb school yes later mcu appearance tended among worldending event avenger movie introduced mcu would felt like missed opportunity mention everyone clamoring time funny much nostalgia color perception movie true tasm two dark ending peter failing save gwen fact shoehorned end horrid version goblin deed mention stupid plot element moment moment emotionally effective feel due good andrew garfield emma stone performance movie justice feel earned make sense

"&gt;they're about globe-trotting, space-going, Avengers-member, iron-suit Spider-Man, which for me is kind of not the core of Spider-Man

To be fair, Spider-Man has been doing that sort of thing since the early days of his comics. Secret War is an interstellar event and how he originally got the symbiote suit. I grew up reading the comics too. I get it. People like to think of Spider-Man as this *neighborhood* Spider-Man. But no one really knows what the hell that means except for, ""What da heck is Spaidahman doin' outta Queens!"" 

It doesn't mean that Spider-Man just stays in his own lane, just saves cats in trees and helps old ladies cross the street. It means that he's in way over his head with all of this Avengers stuff. He's just a kid on the Scholastic Bowl team. Or just trying to get to his college classes in time. Just trying to take pictures for some cash. And then Nick Fury tries to recruit him. Or Mr. Fantastic. Or the X-Men. He's one of the best known superheroes with one of the best-known secret identities in comics, because in his story he works so hard to protect it. What it really means is that Spider-Man is a superhero who *chooses* to go back to his stomping grounds at the end of the adventure. He chooses his high school crush. He takes care of his elderly aunt. He still hangs with his best friends from high school. He opts to stay close to home. New York is his heart.  

Now as much as the other series did a decent job showing the spider in the big apple, I don't think they did as good of a job showing us Peter having the choice between that globetrotting power and turning it down time and again. He answers the call when he needs to, but he still comes back to NYC when the job is done. Even when Tony Stark offers him fame, power, belonging with people just like him, and a father figure he's been missing for a while. Even when he's given the glasses and an opportunity to make a difference on another level, he chooses to give that up and give the glasses to Mysterio. Partially because he's still just a kid, in over his head. Partially because he knows the people back home need him.",False,gt globetrotting spacegoing avengersmember ironsuit spiderman kind core spiderman fair spiderman sort thing since early day comic secret war interstellar event originally got symbiote suit grew reading comic get people like think spiderman neighborhood spiderman one really know hell mean except da heck spaidahman outta queen mean spiderman stay lane save cat tree help old lady cross street mean way head avenger stuff kid scholastic bowl team trying get college class time trying take picture cash nick fury try recruit mr fantastic xmen one best known superheroes one bestknown secret identity comic story work hard protect really mean spiderman superhero chooses go back stomping ground end adventure chooses high school crush take care elderly aunt still hang best friend high school opts stay close home new york heart much series decent job showing spider big apple think good job showing u peter choice globetrotting power turning time answer call need still come back nyc job done even tony stark offer fame power belonging people like father figure missing even given glass opportunity make difference another level chooses give give glass mysterio partially still kid head partially know people back home need

"Wow, I love these new Spider-Man movies but this looks bad. The multiverse thing was done exceptionally well in Into the Spider-Verse, doing it now just feels like they're cannibalizing their own property. Why does alternative universe Green Goblin have any significance for Peter if there's no Green Goblin that *this* Peter knows or fought? If these villains who ""all died fighting Spider-Man"" died fighting THIS Spider-Man, his motivation is clear, he wants to try to make right the tragic deaths of these men from his past. They're total strangers, I don't understand why they couldn't just have a Doctor Octopus existing in this world. Also, get Doctor Strange out of my Spider-Man, he's always been Marvel's most liked because he's the down to earth one, his powers are clear, he has a well-explored private life, remove the guy that can do basically anything, including reversing time and whatever multiverse crap is happening. Can Doctor Strange not use his limitless power to defeat the crazy man in the power ranger costume throwing orange bombs? That's all the Green Goblin in when you've removed him from Peter's complicated private life, being the father of his best friend was a huge reveal in the comics, and one that was very controversial within Marvel at the time. He doesn't know Peter in this universe, so he's just a guy throwing crap, who cares? Sandman is dad, wants money, sure. Don't know why they pulled from the Spectacular Spider-Man movies, since people hated them if they bothered to see them, why resurrect it in any capacity when the entire point of this fresh start was to get away from it? Also, that Marvel movie snark that's in everything is just unbearable at this point. Yeah, his name is Otto Octavius, yours is Peter Parker, they're both as equally comic booky, and Otto isn't that uncommon a name to be in incredulous disbelief. He didn't say, ""My name is Doctor Octopus"", which would've at least better justified that awful punchline. 

Also, can Ned and MJ just stay home and not be laughing and correcting the people that matter with that really annoying attitude? For like the fifth time in the Spider-Man movies to have come out in my life, they're referencing the infamous ""Night Gwen Stacy Died"", where the Green Goblin dropped her off the Washington(I think?) Bridge. It was shocking because while Spider-Man has always kept his two lives separate, the Green Goblin found and killed his completely innocent girlfriend (who writers have never stopped obsessing over), and Peter Parker, with his mask off, shouts that he's going to KILL Norman Osborn for it, while he's been largely sympathetic to his Insanity before. Doing that here means nothing if she's along for the ride, talking mess at people, not to mention the fact that Gwen and Norman were hugely important people in Peter's life and one killed the other and died in turn. All of that drama is gone, so I guess I don't care if Green Goblin kills MJ? She shouldn't be anywhere near this, she's not the main character, she's important to Peter but has no stake in his life as Spider-Man, the fact that he is Spider-Man at all is a burden and intrusion on his nice normal life, that he could have at any time if he felt like it, but won't, because of Uncle Ben's whole ""great power"" bit. 

Maybe I'll end up seeing it, years from now, but I really feel like they made every wrong decision, I don't at all understand what they were thinking",True,wow love new spiderman movie look bad multiverse thing done exceptionally well spiderverse feel like cannibalizing property alternative universe green goblin significance peter green goblin peter know fought villain died fighting spiderman died fighting spiderman motivation clear want try make right tragic death men past total stranger understand could doctor octopus existing world also get doctor strange spiderman always marvel liked earth one power clear wellexplored private life remove guy basically anything including reversing time whatever multiverse crap happening doctor strange use limitless power defeat crazy man power ranger costume throwing orange bomb green goblin removed peter complicated private life father best friend huge reveal comic one controversial within marvel time know peter universe guy throwing crap care sandman dad want money sure know pulled spectacular spiderman movie since people hated bothered see resurrect capacity entire point fresh start get away also marvel movie snark everything unbearable point yeah name otto octavius peter parker equally comic booky otto uncommon name incredulous disbelief say name doctor octopus would least better justified awful punchline also ned mj stay home laughing correcting people matter really annoying attitude like fifth time spiderman movie come life referencing infamous night gwen stacy died green goblin dropped washington think bridge shocking spiderman always kept two life separate green goblin found killed completely innocent girlfriend writer never stopped obsessing peter parker mask shout going kill norman osborn largely sympathetic insanity mean nothing along ride talking mess people mention fact gwen norman hugely important people peter life one killed died turn drama gone guess care green goblin kill mj anywhere near main character important peter stake life spiderman fact spiderman burden intrusion nice normal life could time felt like uncle ben whole great power bit maybe end seeing year really feel like made every wrong decision understand thinking

"No need to be sarcastic, either you wanna participate in a civil discussion or be a dick about it. Choose one.

I didn't say, nor meant that we should get everything spoiled beforehand. This is special case where we kinda know what the twist is, and we've been discussing this twist for a very long time. Pictures from the set, meetings between actors, invisible punches in foreign trailers. This is unlike reveals in let's say Sixth Sense or &lt;insert spoiler worthy movie here&gt;, simply because we never had discussion about the twist before the movie was even released. With all the things we know, it would be very smart to tease 3 Spideys, without actually revealing them. These are smart people behind those movies, and I'm sure they'd figure out a cool way to do it.

I also don't agree that the level of discussion is even remotely close to other movies. Neither Star Wars nor Marvel movies in recent memory had ""twists"" that next day appeared everywhere on the internet. With this movie it will be different. There will be memes on reddit as people are watching the premiere. Next day it will be sea of Toby doing dance moves or all three of them in the ""no, you are Spiderman"" meme pose pointing fingers at each other.

Lastly, I don't think movies market to premier audiences, not anymore. Because of Covid we have less theaters open and less available seats. We also have people that won't or cannot go, due again to Covid. All of this directly translates to smaller audiences and smaller revenue. Smart way to market now is to go for the long stretch.",False,need sarcastic either want participate civil discussion dick choose one say meant get everything spoiled beforehand special case kind know twist discussing twist long time picture set meeting actor invisible punch foreign trailer unlike reveals let u say sixth sense lt insert spoiler worthy movie gt simply never discussion twist movie even released thing know would smart tease three spideys without actually revealing smart people behind movie sure would figure cool way also agree level discussion even remotely close movie neither star war marvel movie recent memory twist next day appeared everywhere internet movie different meme reddit people watching premiere next day sea toby dance move three spiderman meme pose pointing finger lastly think movie market premier audience anymore covid le theater open le available seat also people go due covid directly translates smaller audience smaller revenue smart way market go long stretch

You can see this influence clearly in the Star Wars sequel films. Best example is the opening of The Last Jedi when Poe is literally prank calling the leader of the First Order and making your mom jokes. It’s just bad writing. It’s jarring, it’s inconsistent with the characters, and it doesn’t fit the circumstances.

Also given how little we *actually* know, we have no context for those dialogue points so how will we know if they fit or not? Another classic trailer move: show characters behaving out of character so people are like “what’s going on with dr. Strange in this movie?”

Clips from dreams or visions are great for this. You could have had a shot in the ultron trailer of iron man surrounded by all the dead heroes, and guaranteed there would be people who saw the trailer and were like “what? They all die? That’s so out of character” before seeing the movie lol

"First of all I think that’s a pretty valid thing to be annoyed by. Comparing saturation of movies to thousands of people dying is pretty fucking callous.

And frankly it tells me a lot about you that you think the two are comparable. 

And honestly dude they are the biggest movies in the world, of course they get talked about. But things like this happen throughout cinematic history.

Dracula helped create the genre of monster horror movies that also gave us Frankenstein, the Mummy, the Wolfman and the creature from the black lagoon among others and by the fifties men in monster costumes were common place.

The Lost World, King Kong  and Godzilla ushered in the age of giant claymation monster movies. Jaws ushered in an entire sub genre of ‘underwater monster’ movies. 

Star Wars changed the face of the blockbuster forever and introduced audiences to the idea that serialised action and special effects were the way of the future so action movies became much more effect focused and streamlined. 

Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings began the love affair with adaptations of novels both fantasy and YA which spawned Hunger Games and Game of Thrones among many others. 

And after some success in the 80’s and 90’s comic book movies became much more commonplace and Marvel set the new trend by really pioneering the cinematic universe (technically not the first as Universal did that with their monster movies but Marvel took it a step further) and so other film studios started trying to mimic their formula to varying levels of success.

My point?

**All of film history is in some way or another based on following trends. That’s because culture is an ever changing landscape. Superhero movies and cinematic universes are just the new trend and one day it will be replaced by other trends.**

Complaining about all this “trend chasing” the most boomer shit ever. Because to act like this is a new phenomenon is to act like the last century of film history never happened.

And again **no one is forcing you to inject yourself into these conversations you are choosing to be a part of** 

And certainly **no one forced you to compare this to 911!**

"Because the whole idea of Peter Parker is that he’s meant to be an Everyman. A harmless skinny dorky nerd who blends into the background and became a superhero by sheer accident and decided out of the goodness of his heart to be a hero. 

It’s a power fantasy for nerds and for average people with average physiques that they can be heroic too. Given many comic book stories go out of their way to make their heroes as cool and badass and sexy as possible, Peter Parker the awkward dork who became a hero by accident resonates. 

Peter Parker is NOT cool, he borders on being pathetic. Even when he quips during fights (in the comics and some of the movies at least) he still comes off as kind of an idiot and some of the villains even find him annoying. He might have confidence suited up but he is still an awkward dork.

That effect is lost if Peter Parker looks like a shredded male model, is brooding and mysterious and confident and does typically ‘cool’ things. I know Moviebob gets a lot of well deserved scorn on this subreddit but his takes on movies aren’t bad and in 2012 he summarised it really well: “they tried to make Spider-Man into Edward Cullen.”

Now does Spider-Man HAVE to be an awkward dork? No, in fact my favourite Spider-Man isn’t even Peter Parker it’s Miles Morales. But if you are going to do a Peter Parker story why strip all of his unique characteristics and just turn him into another brooding tragic hunk?

What average person can relate to that? Now granted I have my issues with MCU Spider-Man in that he basically has a tech billionaire sponsoring him and mentoring him which really undermines his “man of the people” character but Tom Holland still plays him like an awkward nerdy zoomer who had social media, thinks Star Wars is an ‘old movie’ and is really self conscious and constantly having to psyche himself up. Heck his first kiss with MJ was intentionally awkward because at his core Spider-Man is a kid who got powers by accident and doesn’t know how to handle it. 

They may have updated things (not always for the best, see Spider-Man for control of a global drone network which I hate) but the best adaptations stay true to the point of the character. He’s an Everyman who just got lucky.

"I've got a few pretty huge disagreements with your interpretations of the character. First and foremost

&gt;decided out of the goodness of his heart to be a hero. 

His premise for being a hero is an equal mix of guilt and responsibility. There's no ""goodness of his heart"" mixed into this. He's a genuinely bad person that slowly develops into a hero because he was taught to be, and because he feels a need to be.
